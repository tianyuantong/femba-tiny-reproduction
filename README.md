## About

**BioFoundation** is a flexible and extensible codebase for deep learning with biological signals. This repository is designed to support a variety of research projects, and currently hosts the work of multiple papers on EEG analysis.

This repository is built on PyTorch Lightning and Hydra to enable reproducible and scalable research.

## 🤗 Pretrained Weights on Hugging Face

Looking for ready-to-use weights of models? We host them on Hugging Face:

### Currently available:
- **FEMBA** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06438)) [![HF Model Card](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model%20Card-FEMBA-ffcc4d?logo=huggingface&logoColor=black)](https://huggingface.co/thorir/FEMBA)
- **LUNA** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22257)) [![HF Model Card](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model%20Card-LUNA-ffcc4d?logo=huggingface&logoColor=black)](https://huggingface.co/thorir/LUNA)


#### Why FEMBA?
- **Scales to long EEG** with linear-time Mamba (no quadratic attention).
- **Strong results** on TUAB/TUAR/TUSL with ready task-specific checkpoints.
- **Simple fine-tune path:** set `CHECKPOINT_DIR`, run `+experiment=FEMBA_finetune`.

**➡️ Model hub:** https://huggingface.co/thorir/FEMBA  
**📄 Model card:** [FEMBA on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/thorir/FEMBA) — benchmarks, protocols, and efficiency notes.  
**📜 Weights license:** CC BY-ND 4.0 (use + redistribute **unmodified** weights with attribution; no redistribution of **modified** weights)  
**🧑‍🍳 PR-gated improvements:** If you fine-tune internally and want your variant to become an **official** FEMBA release, open a PR with configs, logs, and evals. We’ll review together; if it looks good, we’ll retrain/validate and publish an **official** FEMBA checkpoint.
**What you’ll find on the hub**
- `TUAB/` → abnormal EEG (base/large)
- `TUAR/` → artifact detection (tiny/base/large)
- `TUSL/` → slowing classification (variants as in the paper)

Quick download with `huggingface_hub`:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```
```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

# downloads all task folders (TUAB/TUAR/TUSL) and safetensors into ./checkpoints/FEMBA
snapshot_download(repo_id="thorir/FEMBA", repo_type="model", local_dir="checkpoints/FEMBA")
```

Use the paths directly in your runs, e.g.:
```bash
export DATA_PATH=/path/to/data
export CHECKPOINT_DIR=checkpoints/FEMBA/TUAR/base.safetensors
python -u run_train.py +experiment=FEMBA_finetune
```

#### Why LUNA?
- **Topology-agnostic** EEG via **query-based channel unification** (consistent latent across arbitrary montages).
- **Linear-in-channels** compute & memory (unifies channels **before** temporal modeling; no quadratic spatio-temporal attention).
- **Pretrained on >21k hours** (TUEG + Siena) with masked-patch reconstruction; strong transfer across datasets/montages.
- **Simple fine-tune path:** pick model size with `LUNA_{base,large,huge}.yaml`, set `pretrained_safetensors_path`, run `+experiment=LUNA_finetune`.

**➡️ Model hub:** https://huggingface.co/thorir/LUNA  
**📄 Model card:** [LUNA on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/thorir/LUNA) — variants, configs, and fine-tuning walkthrough.  
**📜 Weights license:** CC BY-ND 4.0 (use + redistribute **unmodified** weights with attribution; no redistribution of **modified** weights)  
**🧑‍🍳 PR-gated improvements:** If you fine-tune internally and want your variant to become an **official** LUNA release, open a PR with configs, logs, and evals. We’ll review; if it looks good, we’ll retrain/validate and publish an **official** LUNA checkpoint.

**What you’ll find on the hub**
- `Base/`, `Large/`, `Huge/` → LUNA size variants (matching `config/model/LUNA_{base,large,huge}.yaml`)
- Task-specific heads/checkpoints for common TUH downstream tasks (TUAB / TUAR / TUSL)

Quick download with `huggingface_hub`:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```
```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

# downloads LUNA folders and .safetensors into ./checkpoints/LUNA
snapshot_download(repo_id="thorir/LUNA", repo_type="model", local_dir="checkpoints/LUNA")
```

Use the paths directly in your runs like here below:
```bash
python -u run_train.py +experiment=LUNA_finetune /model=LUNA_base \
  pretrained_safetensors_path=/absolute/path/to/checkpoints/LUNA/Base/LUNA_base.safetensors

python -u run_train.py +experiment=LUNA_finetune /model=LUNA_large \
  pretrained_safetensors_path=/absolute/path/to/checkpoints/LUNA/Large/LUNA_large.safetensors

python -u run_train.py +experiment=LUNA_finetune /model=LUNA_huge \
  pretrained_safetensors_path=/absolute/path/to/checkpoints/LUNA/Huge/LUNA_huge.safetensors
```
*If your checkpoint path contains spaces, wrap it in quotes.*

Tips:
- TUH datasets (TUAB/TUAR/TUSL): keep `- override /data_module: finetune_data_module` and set `data_module.*.hdf5_file` to your `{train,val,test}.h5`.  
- Non-TUH (e.g., SEED-V): use `- override /data_module: subject_independent_data_module` and remove the TUH-specific `data_module` block.  
- Match task settings: `classification_type` (`bc`, `mc`, `mmc`, `mcc`) and `model.num_classes` (e.g., TUSL=4, TUAB=2).


## Features

* **Modular Design**: The repository is organized into modules for data loading, models, training tasks, and more, making it easy to extend and adapt for new research projects.
* **Flexible Configuration**: We use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to manage experiment configurations, allowing for easy customization of models, data, and training parameters.
* **Reproducibility**: Our use of `Hydra` and PyTorch Lightning helps ensure that our experiments are reproducible.
* **Extensible**: The repository is designed to be easily extended with new datasets, models, and tasks.

## Installation
To use BioFoundation, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pulp-bio/BioFoundation.git
```
We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can use `conda` or `virtualenv` for this purpose. We have provided a `requirements.txt` file that lists the necessary packages. You can install them using pip, and optionally, you can use `conda` to create a new environment.
```bash
conda create -n BioFoundation
conda activate BioFoundation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Path changes
Throughout the repository, you may find paths that need to be adjusted based on your local setup. For example, the path to the datasets in the configuration files or the scripts that process the datasets. Make sure to update these paths accordingly. They have been named "#CHANGEME" to facilitate finding them.

## Dataset Preparation

The datasets used in this repository should be converted to HDF5 for efficient I/O. Other formats can work, but you’d need to adapt the dataloaders accordingly.
To prepare the TUH EEG datasets (see the [official source](https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/nedc/html/tuh_eeg/index.shtml)), follow these steps:

1. **Download raw data** from the official sources (e.g., TUH EEG corpus).
2. **Preprocess to pickles** (windowing/labels):
   ```bash
   # examples (adjust paths)
   python make_datasets/process_raw_eeg.py tuab --root_dir /eeg_data/TUAB/edf --output_dir /processed_eeg
   python make_datasets/process_raw_eeg.py tusl --root_dir /eeg_data/TUSL/edf --output_dir /processed_eeg
   python make_datasets/process_raw_eeg.py tuar --root_dir /eeg_data/TUAR/edf --output_dir /processed_eeg
   ```
3.  **Bundle into HDF5:**: Use the provided script to process the raw data into HDF5 files.
    ```bash
    # all datasets found under /processed_eeg
    python make_datasets/make_hdf5.py --prepath /processed_eeg --dataset All --remove_pkl

    # or a single dataset
    python make_datasets/make_hdf5.py --prepath /processed_eeg --dataset TUSL --remove_pkl
    ```
    You may need to edit the `prepath` variable in the script to point to the directory where you have downloaded the raw data.
4.  **Update Configs**: so `data_module.*.hdf5_file` points to your `${DATA_PATH}/<DATASET>_data/{train,val,test}.h5`

## How to Run
### Pre-training
To run a pre-training experiment, you can use the `run_train.py` script with the appropriate configuration file. For example in the case of pre-training FEMBA:

```bash
python -u run_train.py +experiment=FEMBA_pretrain

```

### Fine-tuning
To run a fine-tuning experiment, you can use the `run_train.py` script with the appropriate configuration file. For example in the case of fine-tuning FEMBA:

```bash
python -u run_train.py +experiment=FEMBA_finetune

```

> **Tip:** Pretrained FEMBA weights (TUAB/TUAR/TUSL folders) are available on 🤗 Hugging Face:  
> https://huggingface.co/thorir/FEMBA  
> Set `CHECKPOINT_DIR` to the desired `.safetensors` (e.g., `.../TUAR/base.safetensors`) before launching.

Note in both cases one needs to make sure that the dataset that specific experiment is using is downloaded and available in the correct path.

### Contributing improvements to FEMBA weights
We’re excited to see what you build. Because the weights are **CC BY-ND 4.0**, redistribution of **modified** weights (e.g., LoRA/adapters, deltas, pruned or quantized variants) is **not permitted**.  
If you fine-tune internally and believe your results should become an **official** FEMBA release, please open a PR with:
- exact **configs**, **seeds**, and **training scripts**,
- **environment** and **hardware** details,
- **evaluation protocol** (TUAB/TUAR/TUSL), **splits**, and full **metrics** (AUROC/AUPR/BA, FLOPs, memory),
- training and validation **logs**.

Maintainers will review; if accepted, we will retrain/validate and publish a new **official** checkpoint on 🤗 under the same license.

## General Tips

### How to use distributed data parallel?
In your experiment configuration file, add the following arguments
```yaml
trainer:
  accelerator: gpu  # Using GPU
  num_nodes: ${num_nodes}  # The number of computing nodes
  devices: -1  # Automatically uses all GPUs available
  strategy: ddp  # distributed data parallel
```

### How to save GPU memory?
1. Try fairscale checkpointing first. Check [here](https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/nn/checkpoint/checkpoint_activations.html) and [here](https://github.com/ofsoundof/GRL-Image-Restoration/blob/main/models/networks/grl.py#L134)
2. Use sharded training. Check [here](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/advanced/model_parallel.html).
